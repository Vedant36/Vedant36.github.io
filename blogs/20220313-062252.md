# You have a lot of the experiences of all your ancestors but none of their memories

Throughout our lives we learn a lot on our own like:
- how to cook
- how to talk to people(well most of us)
- how to cover your mouth with your elbows when sneezing
- etc.

Recently I realized that unlike these things, we have some experiences pre-built into us when we are born. For example:
- we instinctively try to look towards a loud noise
- we have a way to tell(or try to at least) if something tastes bad and might be harmful
- [sleep cycle][#1]

All these are things that humans have evolved into having by default.
Your ancestors could die if they couldn't notice a loud noise, most probably made by either a carnivore like a lion or a sign of a natural disaster.
Your ancestors could die if they accidentally ate something poisonous.
(Sorry, humans still don't know why exactly sleep is important. We just have some ideas)

Hence by natural selection, only the humans that could do these things survived. And now because of them, you get angry because somebody woke you up.

Edit: I just discovered this same idea is stated in the show "Serial Experiments Lain Episode 12 00:05:50".
