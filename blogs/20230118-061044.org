This fruit is the latest invention of science. It can be used to very accurately measure everything you would ever need to.

** Length

This one is the easiest. Just count the number of times the Dried Fruit Thing goins into the object you're trying to measure.

Just measure it again and again and take the average if you want to be more accurate.

** Time

Step 1: Go to a high cliff and drop the Dried Fruit Thing from above when you want to start measuring.

Step 2: Mark where it was when you want to stop.

Step 3: Measure distance using The Dried Fruit Thing

Step 4: Calculate the time of fall using Einstein's theory of gravity (You want to be accurate don't you?).

** Mass

Step 1: Keep the object you want to measure the mass of on the floor (if one exists nearby, else just place it on yourself).

Step 2: Throw the Dried Fruit Thing at the object horizontally with an accurately measured velocity (how?).

Step 3: Measure the final velocity of the object (ignore friction).

Step 4: Use Feynman diagrams to calculate the mass of the object.


** Mole

I don't get the point of this one. Just grow up and count the atoms.

** Kelvin

Another easy one. Just use you homemade energy to mass converter, measure the mass as shown above, and hence calculate the energy of the system.

** Ampere

Same as Mole. Just count the electrons.

** Candela

Irrelevant

** Other uses

- It feels nice in the hand.
- Terrorize neighbors with your accurate measurements.
